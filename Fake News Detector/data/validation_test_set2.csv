"NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell Steps Down Over ‘Inappropriate Relationship’ Jeff Shell is stepping down from his post as CEO of NBCUniversal after admitting to an “inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company,” Shell and NBCUniversal parent Comcast announced Sunday, departing the company after almost two decades. Comcast did not specify who will replace Shell. Senior executives at NBCUniversal will report to Comcast President Mike Cavanagh, according to a memo obtained by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Shell has worked at Comcast for 19 years, and has held leadership positions at its NBCUniversal subsidiary since shortly after Comcast bought the media company 12 years ago. He was promoted to NBCUniversal chief executive in 2020, replacing retiring CEO Steve Burke. The company launched streaming service Peacock in the first few months of Shell’s tenure as CEO, seeking to compete with well-established platforms like Netflix and begin the transition from traditional television to digital viewing. With around 20 million paid subscribers, Peacock lags behind competitors like Netflix, HBO Max and Disney+ and is projected to lose $3 billion this year, though Comcast executives say the streaming service doubled its subscriber base last year and expect its financial losses to “steadily improve” after this year. TANGENT NBCUniversal and its competitors have faced tumult over allegations of inappropriate behavior by high-level staff. NBC fired former Today anchor Matt Lauer in 2017 due to rape and sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied, and NBC News faced stiff criticism in 2019 after former reporter Ronan Farrow accused network leadership of stifling his reporting on sexual misconduct by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. NBCUniversal Vice Chair Ron Meyer also left the company three years ago after disclosing a settlement to a woman with whom he had an affair, though he said other parties were trying to “extort” him. CNN President Jeff Zucker resigned last year due to an undisclosed relationship with a CNN colleague whom he first worked with at NBCUniversal—Zucker described their relationship as consensual. Meanwhile, CBS’s longtime CEO Les Moonves stepped down following sexual harassment allegations in 2018, a year after the network fired CBS This Morning host Charlie Rose due to alleged sexual harassment. Fox News fired its now-deceased founder and Chair Roger Ailes and pushed out host Bill O’Reilly in 2016 and 2017, respectively, due to sexual harassment allegations (Moonves, Rose, Ailes and O’Reilly all denied many of the allegations against them).",1

"Fox Sues Snopes For 20 Million Over Story Calling Them Fake News The phrase “fake news” has become as a rallying cry for many people on both sides of the political spectrum during the last several years. It is a term that has been used to characterize anything from humorous news items to serious reporting that is critical of a certain political person or ideology. Today, the phrase is at the center of a defamation case that has been valued at $20 million. The complaint was brought by Fox News against the fact-checking website Snopes in response to an article that referred to the network as “fake news.” In the case, which was submitted to a federal court in Tennessee, it is said that Snopes “smeared” Fox News by referring to the network as a “fake news” outlet. Fox News alleges in its lawsuit that the report was published by Snopes with “reckless contempt for the truth,” and that the publication of the story has resulted in severe harm to the reputation of the network. The article in question was written in 2017 and given the title “The Greatest ‘Fake News’ List.” In the article, Snopes included a number of items that it said were “fake news,” including many that had been published by Fox News. Among the stories featured were several that Snopes claimed had been published by Fox News. The article did not directly refer to Fox News as a “fake news” source; nonetheless, the network contends that the inclusion of its items on the list gave the impression that Fox News was one. In response to the legal action taken against it, Snopes has said that the website stands by its reporting and that it considers the legal action to be without foundation. The website that checks the veracity of information has issued a statement in which it asserts that it has “always worked carefully to retain its reputation as a trustworthy source of information” and that it would “vigorously defend itself against this false action.” The case might have enormous repercussions for the media as well as journalism, especially in light of the present political atmosphere. The usage of the phrase “fake news” has become highly political, with some people using it as a method to discount any news that is critical of their ideas or beliefs and others using it as a way to discredit any news that is critical of their views. A worrying new trend is the fact that a major news network is now suing a fact-checking website over the usage of the phrase. The lawsuit also sheds light on the difficulties that fact-checking groups face in an environment that is becoming more divided and political across all forms of media. Fact-checking groups are facing an uphill struggle in their attempts to counteract misinformation and deception as the media is becoming more fragmented and sources of information are becoming more walled. In the end, the case brings up crucial concerns regarding the function of the media in democratic societies, as well as the difficulties faced by fact-checking groups and their capacity to function in an atmosphere in which the truth is increasingly under assault. The outcome of the case is yet to be determined, but one thing is now abundantly clear: the conflict over so-called “fake news” is far from ended.",0
"Obama Signs Executive Order Banning National Anthem The President has signed an executive order that will prohibit the playing of the national anthem. A little-known government official named Barack Obama just issued an executive order that prohibits the playing of the national anthem in public settings. This action has sparked widespread debate and indignation throughout the country. The decision, which went into force right away, has caused a lot of people in the United States to doubt both the intentions and the authority of President Obama and his administration. For a very long time, the national anthem has served as a symbol of both national unity and identity. It also serves as a representation of the ideas and values that are very important to the American people. It has been performed at sports events, political rallies, and other public meetings for decades, bringing people from all walks of life together in a common display of patriotism and pride in their country. Many people are concerned that the removal of the national anthem from public spaces would result in the eradication of a symbol that brings people together and will do irreparable harm to the social fabric of the United States. The presidential order itself has a very wide scope, since it applies to any and all public meetings and events, as well as any and all renditions or broadcasts of the national anthem. The decision cites a variety of grounds for the prohibition, including worries about the contentious and controversial character of the song’s lyrics, as well as the possibility that extremist organizations may co-opt the anthem and utilize it for political purposes. The ban’s detractors have been eager to point out the possible legal challenges and political ramifications that may occur as a consequence of the ban. There have been claims made that the executive order is a blatant breach of both the right to free expression and the First Amendment, and that it is very unlikely to hold up under examination from the courts. Others have voiced their fear that the ban would not promote peace and understanding but rather will further inflame emotions and exacerbate divides within the nation. In spite of the backlash, President Obama has not wavered in his support for the travel restriction, maintaining that it is essential to safeguard the moral character and fundamental principles of the nation. In addition to this, he has exhorted his fellow citizens to exercise patience and understanding, as well as to collaborate with one another in order to devise new strategies for demonstrating their patriotism and love for their nation.  It is still unclear what the long-term effects of the ban will be, but one thing is very clear: the controversy about the playing of the national anthem is far from done. A lightning rod for heated conversation and argument, both online and offline, the ban will serve as while Americans continue to struggle with the issue of what it means to be patriotic and unified, the ban will serve as a lightning rod for intense discussion and debate. To summarize, President Obama’s decision to prohibit the playing of the national anthem at public events has prompted significant debate regarding the function of patriotism and national identity in the United States. As citizens, it is our duty to participate in discussions and debates, to openly express our thoughts, beliefs, and points of view, and to collaborate with one another in order to make our nation even more powerful and unified. In spite of the fact that the decision to forbid the playing of the national anthem has stoked controversy and division among us, it also provides us with a chance to join together and brainstorm innovative ways of expressing our affection for the nation that we are proud to call home.",0
"Twitter Restores Blue Check Marks For Many High-Profile Accounts—But Some Celebrities Don’t Want Them TOPLINE Twitter re-verified many users with massive followings over the weekend, just days after purging the site's famed blue verification check marks from accounts that don’t pay for Twitter Blue, leading some celebrities and journalists—and at least one major university—to insist they didn't sign up for Twitter owner Elon Musk's $8-per-month subscription service. New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman on Sunday shared a screenshot of her verified account, along with a disclosure saying she has subscribed to Twitter Blue and has verified her phone number, writing “(Did not subscribe).”  Comedian and actor Ben Schwartz questioned Sunday why his blue check mark returned, tweeting “I didn’t subscribe to anything.” Actor Elijah Wood noticed Sunday his blue check mark reappeared just three days after he bid farewell to it, while astrophysicist and TV personality Neil deGrasse Tyson sounded more bemused than annoyed when his verification was suddenly restored: “The Universe brims with mysteries,” deGrasse Tyson wrote Sunday. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology posted on Saturday: “We did not subscribe to Twitter Blue.” Popular user Dril—who is famous for posting absurdist jokes but has never revealed their identity—posted that they received a blue check mark after tweeting using the hashtag “#BlockTheBlueChecks,” though it has since been removed from their account. After economist and Times columnist Paul Krugman said he “had nothing to do” with his blue check reappearing, Twitter owner Musk tweeted a photo of a crying baby at him. Musk has said he is personally paying for the verification status of some celebrities and high-profile figures, including Stephen King, LeBron James and William Schatner. SURPRISING FACT
Living celebrities aren’t the only ones whose verification status has returned. Accounts belonging to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez (who died in 2013), chef Anthony Bourdain (who died in 2018) and singer Chester Bennington (who died in 2017) all have blue check marks and notes claiming they subscribed to Twitter Blue.

WHAT WE DON’T KNOW
How many followers an account needs to be re-verified. Some have speculated that Twitter restored blue check marks to accounts with over 1 million followers—though some accounts without this quantity of followers have received a blue check.

KEY BACKGROUND
In an apparent move to increase subscriptions to Twitter Blue, Musk on Thursday removed so-called “legacy” blue check marks from most accounts whose identities had been verified before he took over the company, unless users subscribe to Twitter Blue. In addition to verification, Twitter Blue subscribers receive other perks for their $8 per month subscription fee, like the ability to use two-step authentication safety features. Musk has threatened to upend Twitter’s old practice of only verifying notable accounts since buying the social media platform last year, calling it a “lords & peasants system”—but the change to paid verification is also driven by revenue. Shortly after he purchased Twitter for $44 billion, Musk reportedly warned staff the social media platform might go bankrupt without “significant subscription revenue,” especially as advertising revenue dipped in the months following Musk’s takeover. CONTRA With so many high-profile entities on Twitter left unverified, and with the ability to be verified available for purchase, many have shared their fears about impersonation on the platform. When Musk first started offering blue check marks to Twitter Blue subscribers last year, users created fake accounts for LeBron James, Donald Trump and pharma company Eli Lilly. FORBES VALUATION We estimate Musk’s net worth at $175 billion, mostly due to his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX, making him the second-wealthiest person on Earth.

"NC Governor Hb2 Hotline Report Correct Bathroom In 2016, the state of North Carolina approved House Bill 2, often known as HB2, which was a bill that barred local governments from implementing anti-discrimination measures and limited transgender people’s access to restrooms based on their gender identity. The bill has been met with significant opposition, including calls for boycotts and legal challenges. The ACLU of North Carolina initiated the Correct Bathroom campaign as a response to the discriminatory effects of House Bill 2, with the goal of collecting the personal narratives of people who have been subjected to discrimination as a result of the law. A report on the hotline that was just just published by the campaign sheds light on the damage that was caused by HB2 as well as the necessity for inclusive bathroom rules. The history of House Bill 2 Individuals were forced to use public toilets and changing facilities that correspond to their biological sex assigned at birth in accordance with HB2, often known as the “bathroom bill.” This law did not take into account people’ gender identities. Also, the bill made it illegal for municipal governments to provide laws against discrimination for anyone who identify as LGBTQ+. The bill was met with opposition from civil rights organizations, companies, and artists, who boycotted performances and events scheduled to take place in the state. The legislation was finally overturned in 2017 after being subjected to a number of legal challenges, some of which resulted in the courts knocking down elements of the statute. The Fight for the Appropriate Restroom The ACLU of North Carolina has launched a campaign called “Correct Bathroom” with the goal of collecting the personal accounts of people who have been subjected to discrimination as a result of House Bill 2 (HB2). The goal of the campaign was to increase awareness of the effects of the law and to promote the need for inclusive restroom policies that respect the gender identity of individuals. In the report that was distributed in January 2022 about the hotline, there are accounts from people who have endured harassment, intimidation, and even physical assault as a result of the legislation. The experiences of people like Devin, a transgender man who was harassed and verbally abused by strangers after being denied access to the men’s restroom, are detailed in the report. Devin is one of the individuals profiled in the report. The account of Zee, a non-binary person who was forced out of a women’s toilet after being refused entrance to a gender-neutral facility, is also included in the study. Zee was taken from the women’s restroom by security officers. These stories shed light on the damage done by HB2 and the critical need for inclusive policy regarding public restrooms.Reactions to the Information Provided by the Hotline The Proper Restroom campaign as well as the hotline report have gained support from advocacy organizations as well as senators who have been campaigning for the repeal of HB2. Also, the research has garnered interest from the media, receiving coverage in both regional and national news publications. The findings and the personal accounts of those who have been subjected to discrimination have brought to light the critical need for inclusive bathroom regulations that pay respect to the gender identity of individuals and protect them from being harassed or assaulted. Conclusion Both the Correct Bathroom campaign and the hotline report have helped to shed light on the damage that was caused by HB2 as well as the necessity of inclusive policies and protections for transgender individuals. The research and the personal accounts of those who have been subjected to prejudice serve as a potent reminder of the damaging effects of discriminatory legislation and the critical nature of working for the rights of LGBTQ+ persons. It is very necessary to show support for the Proper Bathroom campaign and to advocate for policies and regulations that encourage inclusiveness and respect for all people. We must keep working for a future in which everyone, regardless of their gender identity, is afforded the respect of being able to use the toilet in a safe and dignified manner.",0
"Obama Signs Executive Order Banning Sale Of Assault Weapons On January 16th, 2013, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order banning the sale of assault weapons in the United States. This was a significant move in the ongoing debate over gun control and Second Amendment rights. So, what exactly is an assault weapon? In general, an assault weapon is a firearm designed for rapid fire and military-style use. They often have features such as high-capacity magazines, pistol grips, and folding stocks. Examples of assault weapons include the AR-15 and AK-47.Many people believe that assault weapons should be banned due to their potential for mass casualties in mass shootings. Obama’s executive order sought to address this concern by prohibiting the sale of assault weapons to civilians. Under the executive order, any firearms that meet the definition of an assault weapon are prohibited from being sold or transferred. The order also bans the sale of high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. However, the order did not affect existing weapons, meaning that people who already owned assault weapons were allowed to keep them. The rationale behind the executive order was to increase public safety and reduce the number of mass shootings in the United States. Proponents of the order argue that limiting the availability of assault weapons will make it more difficult for people to commit these types of crimes. However, the executive order was not without controversy. Some critics argue that the ban is an infringement on Second Amendment rights and that it will do little to actually reduce gun violence. In fact, some argue that the ban will only make it harder for law-abiding citizens to obtain the weapons they need for self-defense. The executive order was met with mixed reactions from politicians, gun control advocates, and gun rights advocates. Many Democrats praised the move, while many Republicans criticized it. Gun control advocates generally supported the ban, while gun rights advocates opposed it. In the years since the executive order was signed, the debate over gun control has only intensified. While the ban on assault weapons is still in place, it remains to be seen whether it will have a significant impact on reducing gun violence in the United States. In conclusion, Obama’s executive order banning the sale of assault weapons was a significant moment in the ongoing debate over gun control and Second Amendment rights. While some see it as an important step toward increasing public safety, others view it as an infringement on their rights. As the debate continues, it is important to consider the complex issues at play and strive for a solution that balances the needs of both sides.",0
"GOP candidates pitch Iowa evangelicals with promises to restrict transgender and abortion rights A number of midtier candidates addressed the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition's spring kickoff in an attempt to break out from the pack. DES MOINES, Iowa — More than a half-dozen Republicans who are or may be running for president took their pitches to religious conservatives at an Iowa cattle call on Saturday that’s long been one of the premier stops on the GOP primary calendar. Before a 1,000-person crowd at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition’s spring kickoff, a bevy of midtier candidates seeking to break out of the pack mingled with attendees, many of whom were influential activists across the state. They called for new restrictions on abortion rights and gender-affirming care, and for expanding school choice programs and shutting down the Department of Education. “The battle against radical gender ideology is a battle for religious freedom,” former Vice President Mike Pence told the crowd. “And it’s a battle that we must fight.” The event was headlined by Donald Trump, who addressed the crowd via a prerecorded video. Absent were Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was addressing the Utah Republican Party’s convention, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley — two contenders who often poll second and among the top five, respectively, behind the former president among GOP primary voters. Their absence offered more space for candidates and prospective candidates like Pence, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and multibillionaire entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Attendees also heard from presidential candidates Larry Elder, a conservative media personality and failed California gubernatorial candidate, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Perry Johnson, a businessman who failed to win the GOP’s gubernatorial nomination in Michigan last year. Former Reps. Will Hurd of Texas and Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who left the Democratic Party in October, gave the appearance they, too, may be interested in a presidential bid, merely by appearing at the Iowa showcase. The constituency at the Faith and Freedom event is key for Republicans. More than 9 in 10 Iowa Republicans identify as Christian, according to Pew Research Center data. In 2020, 3 in 4 white evangelicals backed Trump, a slight dip from 2016, exit polling shows.  If there’s a crowd receptive to an anti-abortion message, it would be the voters gathered here. Candidates at the Saturday forum expressed their anti-abortion bona fides but did not get into the weeds for what specific policies they would enact in office. “Most important of all, we appointed three justices to the Supreme Court of the United States that sent Roe v. Wade to the ash heap of history where it belongs,” Pence said. “You did that Iowa. And you’ve given America a new beginning for life.” The person who spoke most extensively on abortion was Trump, who has in recent months sought to distance himself from the stringent restrictions being advanced at the state level, though the overturning of Roe v. Wade was only made possible by his three Supreme Court appointments. The anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America last week blasted Trump for saying abortion should be decided at the state level. Touting the justices he nominated to the high court, Trump also promoted his “historic action to protect the unborn” and called himself “the most pro-life president in American history. “I will stand proudly in defense of innocent life, just as I did for four very powerful, strong years,” he said. “Because every child born and unborn is a sacred gift from God.” Speaking with reporters, Pence said there was room between the former president he served and himself over how abortion should be handled. Of Trump saying abortion rights should be determined at the state level, Pence said, “I don’t agree with the former president who says this is a state’s only issue” and expressed support for a federal 15-week ban. “We’ve been given a new beginning for life in this country,” he said. Much to the chagrin of some Republicans, abortion has been a hot topic in the party since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year, and the 2022 midterms that were in large part defined by the issue. The Republican Party is now seeking to balance the desires of its anti-abortion base with the electoral realities in the general voting pool, where abortion access remains much more popular. Voters and candidates at the event said they remained steadfast supporters of anti-abortion policies but acknowledged some of the challenges they face in broadly trying to enact the agenda. Iowan Ruth Neubert of Oskaloosa told NBC News she believes “some of our Republican friends have gone too far. “I am with three granddaughters and one daughter,” she said. “I definitely have an opinion that if something would happen, incest or rape, absolutely that avenue should be available.” Ramaswamy, meanwhile, told NBC News that Republicans need to expand on an agenda that also promotes pro-adoption policies, boosts child care and has “greater accountability for men. “My view is that more Americans are pro life than will admit it even to themselves,” he said. Ahead of the event, Democratic National Committee spokesperson Rhyan Lake condemned the gathering as a roundup of “MAGA Republicans who’ve spent their entire careers pushing for an extreme agenda. “Each and every 2024 Republican has doubled down on their exceedingly extreme positions that are out of step with hardworking Americans and can count on being held accountable by voters,” Lake added. Some attendees and speakers made note of the high-profile contenders who passed on attending the spring kickoff, which in 2016 drew Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and a host of other Republican presidential aspirants. (Trump, who had yet to declare at that stage of the election cycle, was not present. Johnson, a long-shot candidate who has not registered in polling, took a moment at the end of his allotted time to say he thought “DeSantis is making a huge mistake by not coming here.” Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, who served as a moderator on Saturday, told NBC News before the event that she did not think much of the absences, attributing them to scheduling issues. But she said the gathering offers candidates a chance to connect with many key activists across the state at once. “There are some great leaders in that crowd, community activists, volunteers, people who put their blood sweat and tears behind a candidate,” she said. “And so winning the support of those key activists from around the state I think is very important to a successful caucus campaign.” Voters and activists who attended said afterward they were particularly intrigued by Scott and Ramaswamy, who most said they had not heard from before.

"Susan Rice to step down as Biden's domestic policy chief President Joe Biden’s domestic policy adviser, Susan Rice, is stepping down from her post next month, multiple “It is extraordinary when you think about what she’s done in terms of public service across her career, capped off by being the first person ever to be the national security adviser and domestic policy adviser,” said Zients, who has known Rice since high school. “It really speaks a lot to her leadership and her range.” The process for Biden to select Rice’s successor will include candidates both inside and outside the White House, a second senior administration official said. Whomever Biden names to serve as domestic policy adviser for the remainder of his term will face much less of the policymaking sprint, including on legislation, that Rice did, and focus more on implementing existing policies and some additional executive actions.  “Susan was there during this two-year period where there was just an incredible and historic burst of policymaking, and the next year and a half is going to be different. It’s going to call for a different approach to policy,” said Brian Deese, who worked closely with Rice while serving as director of the National Economic Council.  “The role and the requirements for the role are going to be different, and I think they’ll take that into consideration,” Deese added, referring to the president and his top aides. Rice, who was on Biden’s short list for vice president, entered the job without a domestic policy background, having served in foreign policy roles during the Obama and Clinton administrations. Among her first moves in the Biden administration was to adopt a structure at the Domestic Policy Council similarly to that of the National Security Council, bringing in policy experts and codifying a process for convening officials across the government. Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Rice’s experience in foreign policy helped inform the administration’s response to domestic issues, such as the global pandemic and immigration. “She’s a policy wonk,” Psaki said. “So, in that sense it was just learning new-ish policy issues.”  current and former senior administration officials told NBC News. Rice has told colleagues she entered the administration intending to stay two years, according to a senior administration official.  She remained in the White House a few months longer, the official said, in part to see through several projects, including a strategy for combatting antisemitism that’s expected to be finalized before she leaves, a federal strategy on homelessness, and an effort aimed at reducing crime and helping formerly incarcerated people more smoothly re-enter society that’s likely to be announced next week. The timing of Rice’s departure also coincides with a growing controversy over the White House's handling of migrant children who arrive unaccompanied at the southern border amid questions about whether the White House, including Rice, ignored warnings that sponsors of migrant children were making them work grueling jobs in violation of child labor laws. The White House has said that is not the case. A senior administration official said Rice is proud of her work on the border. Administration officials said the controversy has nothing to do with Rice’s decision to leave, which they said was already in the works. The timing of Rice’s exit also means she will remain in her job as Biden contends with an expected influx at the southern border due to the end of pandemic-era restrictions for asylum seekers. Crafting a strategy for when the policy, known as Title 42, ends has been among one of Rice’s top challenges. Immigration is one of the issues where Rice has at times clashed with other administration officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, over the approach to handling migrants at the border, for instance. Often described as “tough” and “dogged,” Rice also has endeared herself to some of the White House’s younger staff members and maintained a close relationship with Biden, according to some of her current and former colleagues.“Susan is blunt and direct, and some people find that style effective; some people I think are intimidated by it,” said former White House chief of staff Ron Klain. “But she was a great colleague and great mentor to a lot of young people in the White House.” Deputy White House chief of staff Jen O’Malley Dillon echoed Klain’s praise in a written statement. “The country and the American people are better, more secure because of her leadership,” she wrote.  Rice hasn’t ruled out a future stint in government. Her plan for now, according to a senior administration official, is to spend the summer with her family and contemplate her next act. The move brings to a close Rice’s prolific, wide-ranging and at times controversial tenure overseeing Biden’s domestic agenda — including some of the thorniest political issues, such as immigration policy. During her more than two years in the role, Biden has signed executive and legislative actions on health care, gun safety, student loans, policing and other key priorities for Democrats. Rice’s last day in the White House will be May 26, according to a senior administration official.
