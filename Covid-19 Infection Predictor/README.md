Since 2019, we have been experiencing the Covid-19 pandemic. The cause of this pandemic has had a significant impact on the lives of citizens as well as the global economy. One of the most important tasks in this pandemic has been determining whether a person is infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. (SARSCoV-
2). To accomplish this, we are using a dataset that records all possible symptoms, physiological, and
geographical parameters to predict infections. The primary goal is to identify the best model for predicting COVID-19 infection in a person.

The dataset used in this project was created based on the WHO guidelines and Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, India and can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamhungundji/covid19-symptoms-checker

The project has two parts Visualisation and Prediction, please refer to report_1 and report_2 for further information on the project.
